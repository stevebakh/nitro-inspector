# Inspect Nitro dataset
Dirty, quickly thrown together bit of code to run through Nitro programmes to do some analysis and find the best way to reduce the size of datasets returned in any given query. The aim was to find an easier way for certain clients to ingest all content, so reducing the number of pages for any resultset would be beneficial (and reduce the chances of the data being updated while the dataset is being paged).

The code isn't pretty.
